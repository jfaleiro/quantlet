QuantLET
========

QuantLET is an open source, event-driven framework for 
rapid development and deployment of real-time analytical 
models intended to be executing in large scale, 
in terms of data intensiveness or computing power 
(your spreadsheet canâ€™t do that).

You can see a [few examples of the framework](https://quantlet.wordpress.com/box) outlining the use of signals in a moving average cross-over strategy or how to define and use 'infinite spreadsheets'.

This project has been moved to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jfaleiro/quantlet). It is being kept private for now.
